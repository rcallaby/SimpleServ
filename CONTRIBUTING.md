## Development Guidelines

### Key Areas to Contribute

- **Core HTTP Functionality:** Improve request handling, file transfer capabilities, or protocol support.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Enhance support for Windows and MacOS.
- **Performance Optimization:** Make the server faster and more efficient.
- **Security Improvements:** Address vulnerabilities or add secure transfer protocols.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear instructions, examples, and tutorials.

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch (`main`)**: Stable, production-ready code.  
- **Feature Branches (`feature/xyz`)**: For developing new features or major fixes.  
- **Bugfix Branches (`bugfix/xyz`)**: For resolving specific issues.  

Before starting work on a feature, ensure an issue exists, or create one. This helps track progress and avoids duplication.

### Commit Message Format

Use clear and descriptive commit messages:
```plaintext
[Category] Short description (50 chars or less)

More detailed explanation (if necessary).
```
**Examples:**
- `[Feature] Add support for HTTPS file transfers.`
- `[Bugfix] Fix segmentation fault on large file uploads.`
