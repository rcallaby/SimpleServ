# SimpleServ

**Since this name was already taken and I made the colossial mistake of choosing it for my project I am archiving this project and transfering it over to a similar project with a different name**

**SimpleServ** is a lightweight HTTP server written in C++ designed for Linux users who need a quick and efficient way to transfer files. Inspired by the simplicity of Python's built-in HTTP server, SimpleServ allows users to serve files seamlessly to clients using tools like `wget` or `curl`. The project is minimalistic yet powerful, focusing on portability, ease of use, and swift file sharing without the need for extensive configurations or dependencies.

The motivation behind creating SimpleServ was primarily driven by curiosity and the desire to explore the intricacies of network programming in C++. While Python's HTTP server is a popular choice for ad-hoc file sharing, SimpleServ showcases how similar functionality can be achieved with the performance and control offered by C++. It provides an opportunity to learn and experiment with HTTP protocols, socket programming, and C++ system-level programming, making it not only a useful tool but also an educational project for enthusiasts.
